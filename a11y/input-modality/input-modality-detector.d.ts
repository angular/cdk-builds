 * keyboard input modality) for two reasons:
 *
 * 1. Modifier keys are commonly used with mouse to perform actions such as 'right click' or 'open
 *    in new tab', and are thus less representative of actual keyboard interaction.
 * 2. VoiceOver triggers some keyboard events when linearly navigating with Control + Option (but
 *    confusingly not with Caps Lock). Thus, to have parity with other screen readers, we ignore
 *    these keys so as to not update the input modality.
 *
 * Note that we do not by default ignore the right Meta key on Safari because it has the same key
 * code as the ContextMenu key on other browsers. When we switch to using event.key, we can
 * distinguish between the two.
